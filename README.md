# Sustainability Management in the Supply Chain Industries in the Americas

## Overview

This project analyzes the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions footprint across different supply chain sectors in the United States, aiming to understand variations and provide actionable insights for carbon footprint reduction. As sustainability becomes a critical aspect of business strategies, understanding the GHG emissions in industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and retail etc is vital for developing strategies to reduce environmental impact.

The goal of this analysis is to help supply chain industries identify areas of improvement and formulate strategies to minimize their carbon footprint.

## Main Research Question

How do greenhouse gas emissions footprints vary across different supply chain sectors in the United States?

## Project Description

This project is focused on analyzing GHG emissions data from different supply chain sectors in the U.S. to compare the emissions footprints of industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and retail. We will use multiple datasets to examine emissions data from these sectors, focusing on transportation-related GHG data. The analysis will involve cleaning and transforming the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying statistical analysis to understand trends across sectors.

Key steps include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends
- Identifying actionable insights for carbon footprint reduction across U.S. supply chains

### Made Project under the MADE Subject

This project was developed as part of the **Methods of Advanced Data Engineering (MADE)** module at FAU Erlangen. During the semester, we explored various data engineering methodologies and applied them in a real-world scenario to understand and reduce carbon footprints in the supply chain industries of the Americas.
