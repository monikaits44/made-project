# Project Plan

## Title
Sustainability Management in the Supply Chain Industries in the America

## Main Question
How do greenhouse gas emissions footprint vary across different supply chain sectors in the America?

## Description
As sustainability becomes an integral part of business strategies, firms must be informed of the type of differences in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between various supply chain sectors to reduce their carbon footprint. This project is hence aimed at considering and analyzing GHG emissions data from different supply chain sectors in the United States. The analysis would compare the emissions footprints of industries such as manufacture, transportation, and retail sectors by analyzing multiple datasets on supply chain emissions, and transportation-related GHG data. Data cleaning and transformation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) would be used to gain insight into how the trend is going across sector after statistical analysis. The takeaway is to provide actionable insights aimed at reducing emissions across supply chains while at the same time pointing to possible areas for improvement for U.S. industries.
