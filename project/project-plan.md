# Project Plan

## Title
Impact of AI Technologies on Economic Growth and Labor Markets in the Americas

## Main Question
How has the use of AI technologies impacted economic growth and labor market trends in North and South America over the past decade?

## Description
With more and more AI technologies integrating into various industries across both Americas, the economic growth and labor markets of these regions have largely been reshaped. The present data science project focuses on examining the relationship between the adoption of AI and major economic variables that account for GDP growth and employment. Therefore, some of the modern techniques of data engineering used in the project are cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis to draw insights into the positive and negative impacts AI has had on job markets and economic performance. EDA and machine learning models will be conducted to create future trends from historical data.
